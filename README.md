  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

* **employee**:
  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manages the employee being Created. This field may be null if the employee has no manager

You can use the provided schema.sql to build the database, and seed.sql to add dummy data to see how the application works.
